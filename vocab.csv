ubiquitous,present everywhere,"Picture a mischievous, ubiquitous unicorn, its shimmery horn leaving a trail of glitter everywhere I look—on my breakfast, my phone, even stuck to my grumpy cat!  ""Ubi"" sounds like ""you be,"" and it's everywhere, you see!"
ephemeral,lasting for a short time,"Picture a firefly, its *ephemeral* (emphasis on the ""ephem,"" like ""ephemeral"" is short like a whisper) light blinking briefly in the night, a fleeting beauty before it fades, leaving only a whisper of memory; its existence as short as a fleeting whisper."
perspicacious,having keen insight,"Picture Percy, a wise old owl perched high on a tree, his piercing eyes (perspicacious) instantly spotting a tiny mouse far below.  His ""perceiving"" gaze reveals hidden truths; he's a master of ""spec"" (speculation/seeing clearly) - he always sees the ""acious"" (active, intense) truth."
veracious,truthful,"Vera, a very honest princess (ver-acious), always wore a crown of shimmering, real emeralds –  never fake, always truthful, like her word."
